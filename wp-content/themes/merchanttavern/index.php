                        Roxy Piscazzi stowed away on a boat to get to America. When he met the love of his life, Lucia, he was forbidden from marrying her. So he kidnapped her and they started a family. Together they owned a bar in North Akron called Roxy’s Café. Lucia cooked in other notable restaurants in Akron. Lucia became known as one of the finest cooks in the area. After Roxy had passed, Lucia and their son John, opened a restaurant in the “Valley” known as the Wine Merchant. They focused <span class="story-callout ir">&#8220; It&#8217;s a poor host who seves his guests poor wine. For he must sit and drink it with them.&#8221;</span> on great wine and great food. From that pioneering establishment grew many of Akron’s best cooks and chefs. Even after the Wine Merchant closed, the legacy lived on.

                        The Merchant Tavern was born out of the principles that the John “The Merch” Piscazzi Lived by. Don’t cut corners. Prepare every meal like you would for your family. Buy only the best ingredients, and keep your food simple but good.

                            I think you are going to want to keep these Text only... and limit the area to say 1 to 3 posts at a time. Does that make sense? Overall This would be the general size and look of a post. Let me know if this is what you were thinking and I can kickstart a conversation with the coding guys and get a general cost and timeframe.
